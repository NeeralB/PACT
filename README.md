# PACT

helping detect and prevent hit and runs road rages and car thefts

For some reason my py files arent loading in python, I will reupload them when I get the chance to later on

Was also unable to upload the dataset as the file was too large. However this was the dataset i used. https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html
